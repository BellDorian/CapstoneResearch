Notes Oct 23

Discussed using one platform to communicate => discord
  This is to keep it easier to see what is happening and what each of us are doing.
  If you are working on code or papers, etc. Please make a short note in the file we are creating called notes. 
  This will make it easier for each of us to see what is happening. Avni and I discussed how we all work at a diferent times.
